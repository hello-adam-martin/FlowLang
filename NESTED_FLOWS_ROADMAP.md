# Nested Flows Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the plan to enable the FlowLang visual designer to fully support complex nested flows, using `flows/examples/loan_approval/flow.yaml` as the reference implementation.

## Current State

### What Works ✅
- Container node types exist (Conditional, Parallel, Loop, Switch)
- Container nodes have drop zones and track child nodes via `parentId`
- Container nodes display child counts ("3 tasks" labels)
- Basic YAML import/export for top-level structures
- Container nodes support quantified conditions (all/any/none) in UI
- Drag-and-drop from node library works

### What's Broken ❌
1. **Child nodes aren't rendered inside containers** - They're tracked in data but invisible
2. **YAML import doesn't recursively parse** - `then`, `else`, `do`, `parallel` arrays ignored
3. **YAML export doesn't reconstruct nesting** - Children exported as flat sequential steps
4. **No visual feedback** when nodes are inside containers
5. **Can't edit nested structures** - No way to add/remove/reorder children
6. **Execution doesn't work for nested flows** - Simulator doesn't handle hierarchy

## The Problem: Loan Approval Flow

The `loan_approval` flow demonstrates the complexity we need to support:

```yaml
# Main screening check (top-level conditional)
- if:
    none: [bankruptcy, foreclosure, low_credit, late_payments]
  then:
    # Premium tier (nested conditional #1)
    - if:
        all: [excellent_conditions]
      then: [approve_premium, send_letter]

    # Standard tier (nested conditional #2)
    - if:
        any: [good_conditions]
      then:
        # Double-nested conditional!
        - if:
            all: [acceptable_conditions]
          then: [approve_standard, send_letter]

    # Manual review (nested conditional #3)
    - if:
        any: [complex_cases]
      then: [flag_review, notify_underwriter]

    - task: RecordDecision  # Sequential task after conditionals

  else:
    - task: RejectLoan
    # Parallel block nested in else!
    - parallel:
        - SendRejectionNotice
        - LogRejection
        - ReportToCreditBureau
        - ScheduleFollowUpCampaign
    - task: RecordDecision  # Sequential task after parallel
```

**Key Challenges:**
- 4 levels of nesting (top conditional → nested conditional → double-nested conditional)
- Parallel block inside else branch
- Sequential tasks mixed with container nodes at same level
- Complex quantified conditions with nested logic

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Child Node Visualization (FOUNDATION) - ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Make child nodes visible inside their parent containers

**UX Enhancements (2025-10-17):**
- ✅ Double-click to open property panel (single-click only selects visually)
- ✅ Removed "fake" connection handles - using standard handles
- ✅ Connection drag-and-drop node creation:
  - Drag connection from any node and release in open space
  - Node library panel slides in from right
  - Click any node type to create it at cursor position (grid-snapped)
  - Automatic connection created between source and new node
  - Works for all node types (tasks and containers) with correct handle IDs
- ✅ Fixed panel positioning with `fixed` positioning to avoid clipping
- ✅ Smart panel state management to prevent premature closing

**Architectural Decision:**
We adopted a **hybrid approach** with two distinct node types:

1. **Container Nodes** (Loop, Parallel)
   - Act as parent containers for child nodes
   - Children have `parentId` pointing to container
   - Support execution order tracking via badges
   - Custom resize handles with padding constraints

2. **Routing Nodes** (Conditional, Switch)
   - Don't contain children - route to separate node chains
   - Multiple output handles representing different paths
   - Simpler than container approach
   - Each output connects to next node in that branch

This hybrid approach provides:
- Clean visual flow representation
- Simpler implementation for branching logic
- Better performance (fewer nested nodes)
- More intuitive editing experience

**Status by Container:**

#### Loop Container - ✅ COMPLETE
**File:** `web/src/components/nodes/LoopContainerNode.tsx`
- ✅ Custom resize handle (bottom-right corner)
- ✅ 30px padding constraint preventing edge positioning
- ✅ Execution order tracking with numbered badges
- ✅ Delete button on hover
- ✅ Grey color scheme
- ✅ Droppable "do" section with visual feedback
- ✅ Children render automatically via ReactFlow parentId
- ✅ Badge positioned top-right
- ✅ Starting dimensions: 250x150px

#### Conditional Container - ✅ REDESIGNED AS ROUTING NODE
**File:** `web/src/components/nodes/ConditionalContainerNode.tsx`
- ✅ Redesigned as routing node (not a container)
- ✅ Two output handles: "then" (green) and "else" (red)
- ✅ Delete button on hover
- ✅ Fixed width (300px) compact design
- ✅ Visual labels showing output semantics
- ✅ No drop zones - routes to next nodes instead

**Architectural Decision:**
- Changed from container with child nodes to routing node with output handles
- Simplifies nesting - conditions route to separate node chains
- Cleaner visual flow representation
- Aligns with Switch container design

#### Parallel Container - ✅ COMPLETE
**File:** `web/src/components/nodes/ParallelContainerNode.tsx`
- ✅ Custom resize handle (bottom-right corner)
- ✅ 30px padding constraint preventing edge positioning
- ✅ Execution order tracking with numbered badges
- ✅ Delete button on hover
- ✅ Grey color scheme
- ✅ Single droppable area (no track system)
- ✅ Children render automatically via ReactFlow parentId
- ✅ Topological sort for dependency-based execution order
- ✅ Badge positioned top-right
- ✅ Starting dimensions: 450x200px

**Implementation:**
- Simplified from track system to single drop zone
- Uses topological sort to calculate execution order based on edges
- Nodes with no incoming edges start in parallel (no badge)
- Connected nodes show execution order badges (1, 2, 3...)

#### Switch Container - ✅ REDESIGNED AS ROUTING NODE
**File:** `web/src/components/nodes/SwitchContainerNode.tsx`
- ✅ Redesigned as routing node (not a container)
- ✅ Multiple output handles for cases + default
- ✅ Delete button on hover
- ✅ Compact vertical design
- ✅ Dynamic case add/remove via UI
- ✅ Visual labels showing case values
- ✅ No drop zones - routes to next nodes instead

**Architectural Decision:**
- Changed from container with case sections to routing node with output handles
- Each case gets its own output handle (colored and labeled)
- Default fallback handle at bottom
- Simpler than container approach, aligns with Conditional design

**Tasks:**
1.1. ✅ Render child nodes in "do" section of LoopContainerNode
1.2. ✅ Redesign ConditionalContainerNode as routing node with output handles (not a container)
1.3. ✅ Redesign SwitchContainerNode as routing node with output handles (not a container)
1.4. ✅ Render child nodes in ParallelContainerNode with execution order tracking
1.5. ✅ Position children relatively within parent bounds (ReactFlow handles this)
1.6. ✅ Add visual indicators (border, background) for container membership (grey scheme applied)
1.7. ✅ Add padding constraints to prevent edge positioning (Loop and Parallel)
1.8. ✅ Add custom resize handles (Loop and Parallel)
1.9. ✅ Add execution order tracking (Loop and Parallel)
1.10. ❌ Handle scrolling when many children (needs testing)

**Test Criteria:**
- [✅] Manually create a loop with task nodes inside
- [✅] Children appear visually inside the loop container boundaries
- [✅] Can see connections between child nodes inside loop
- [✅] Container sections have distinct visual styling
- [✅] Manually create a parallel container with task nodes inside
- [✅] Parallel execution order badges appear based on dependencies
- [✅] Conditional and Switch work as routing nodes with output handles
- [⚠️] Scrolling works if children overflow (needs testing with many nodes)

**Expected Result (ACHIEVED):**
Container nodes (Loop, Parallel):
- ✅ Custom resize handles (bottom-right corner)
- ✅ 30px padding constraints
- ✅ Consistent visual styling
- ✅ Delete on hover
- ✅ Execution order tracking where applicable
- ✅ Professional polish matching Loop container quality

Routing nodes (Conditional, Switch):
- ✅ Multiple output handles with visual labels
- ✅ Compact fixed-width design
- ✅ Clear routing semantics
- ✅ Delete on hover
- ✅ Professional appearance

### Phase 2: Recursive YAML Import
**Goal:** Parse nested flow structures from YAML and create proper node hierarchy

**Files to Modify:**
- `web/src/services/yamlConverter.ts` (yamlToFlow function)

**Tasks:**
2.1. Create `recursivelyParseSteps()` helper function
2.2. Parse conditional `then` array → child nodes with `section: 'then'`, `parentId: conditionalId`
2.3. Parse conditional `else` array → child nodes with `section: 'else'`, `parentId: conditionalId`
2.4. Parse loop `do` array → child nodes with `section: 'do'`, `parentId: loopId`
2.5. Parse parallel array → child nodes with `trackId` assigned, `parentId: parallelId`
2.6. Calculate automatic positions for nested nodes (vertical stacking)
2.7. Calculate container sizes based on child count
2.8. Handle nested containers (recursive parentId chains)
2.9. Support nested quantified conditions (all/any/none with nesting)

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Import `loan_approval.yaml` successfully
- [ ] All task nodes appear in correct container sections
- [ ] Nested conditionals appear as containers within containers
- [ ] Parallel block in else branch renders correctly
- [ ] Node positions are readable (no overlaps)
- [ ] Container sizes accommodate their children

**Expected Result:**
Opening loan_approval.yaml shows the full nested structure visually, with all ~20 task nodes properly nested in their containers.

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE**

All Phase 2 features are implemented and working:
- ✅ Conditional routing nodes with then/else handles and edge following
- ✅ Switch routing nodes with case handles and default fallback
- ✅ Automatic edge coloring (green/red/blue/gray) for routing semantics
- ✅ Round-trip YAML import/export working correctly
- ✅ Simulator updated to support routing nodes (see Phase 2.5 below)

---

### Phase 2.5: Simulator Support for Routing Nodes - ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Update flow simulator to support Phase 2 routing node architecture

**Problem:**
The simulator was designed for the old container architecture where Conditional and Switch had child nodes with metadata. Phase 2 redesigned them as routing nodes that use output handles and edges.

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/services/flowSimulator.ts`

**Changes Made:**
1. **Added `executeChain()` helper (lines 403-433)**
   - Follows a chain of nodes until hitting another routing/container node
   - Used by routing nodes to execute their branches
   - Stops at routing nodes (Conditional, Switch) or containers (Loop, Parallel)

2. **Added `markChainAsSkipped()` helper (lines 435-467)**
   - Marks entire chain of nodes as skipped
   - Used for non-executed branches in Conditional/Switch

3. **Updated `executeConditional()` (lines 223-257)**
   - Follow edges by `sourceHandle` ('then' or 'else') instead of child `section`
   - Use `executeChain()` to follow entire branch chain
   - Mark skipped branch with `markChainAsSkipped()`

4. **Updated `executeSwitch()` (lines 324-372)**
   - Follow edges by `sourceHandle` (`case_case_X` or 'default')
   - Use `executeChain()` for matched case
   - Mark other cases as skipped

5. **Fixed auto-continue logic (lines 153-163)**
   - Prevent automatic edge following after routing nodes (Conditional, Switch)
   - Only task nodes and containers auto-continue
   - Routing nodes handle their own edge following

6. **Fixed `executeLoop()` (lines 262-298)**
   - Find children using `parentId` instead of edges
   - Sort children by Y position for execution order
   - Execute all children sequentially for each iteration

**Test Criteria:**
- [✅] Simulator compiles without errors
- [ ] Test with `test-conditional-import.yaml`: branches execute correctly
- [ ] Test with `test-switch-import.yaml`: case matching works
- [ ] Skipped branches show as skipped in execution visualization

**Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** (testing pending)

---

### Phase 3: Nested Drag & Drop
**Goal:** Support dragging nodes into/out of containers and between sections

**Status: ⏸️ DEFERRED** (optional enhancement - not required for core functionality)

**Files to Modify:**
- `web/src/components/FlowDesigner/FlowDesigner.tsx` (onDrop handler)
- `web/src/components/nodes/ConditionalContainerNode.tsx` (drop zones)
- `web/src/components/nodes/ParallelContainerNode.tsx` (track drop zones)
- `web/src/components/nodes/LoopContainerNode.tsx` (do drop zone)

**Tasks:**
3.1. Detect when drop occurs over container section (then/else/do/track)
3.2. Set `parentId` and section metadata on dropped node
3.3. Position dropped node relative to parent container
3.4. Support dragging node OUT of container back to canvas (remove parentId)
3.5. Support dragging between container sections (then → else)
3.6. Prevent containers from being dropped into themselves
3.7. Update container size when children added/removed
3.8. Handle edge connections when moving nodes between containers

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Can drag task from library into conditional "then" section
- [ ] Task appears inside container with proper parentId
- [ ] Can drag task from "then" to "else" section
- [ ] Can drag task out of container back to main canvas
- [ ] Cannot drop conditional into its own then/else sections
- [ ] Edges remain connected when moving nodes
- [ ] Container auto-resizes when children change

**Expected Result:**
Full interactive editing of nested structures - drag nodes in/out/between containers freely.

**Note:** Phase 3 is optional - users can import YAML files with nested structures and the visualizer works correctly. Drag & drop editing can be added later as an enhancement.

---

### Phase 4: Recursive YAML Export - ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Convert nested node hierarchy back to valid FlowLang YAML

**Files Modified:**
- `web/src/services/yamlConverter.ts` (flowToYaml function)

**Implementation Details:**

**1. Smart Value Serialization (lines 685-726)**
- Added `serializeYamlValue()` function for intelligent quote handling
- Variables unquoted: `${prep.config}` not `"${prep.config}"`
- Simple strings unquoted: `done` not `"done"`
- Only quotes when YAML syntax requires it

**2. Auto-Generated ID Removal (lines 1009-1027)**
- Modified `nodeToStep()` to detect and remove auto-generated container IDs
- Pattern match for `node_0`, `node_1`, etc. and strip them
- Only exports IDs that were in original YAML
- Tasks always keep IDs (required by schema)

**3. Correct Indentation (lines 759, 770)**
- Fixed parallel and loop children indentation
- Changed from `indentLevel + 1` to `indentLevel + 2`
- Matches canonical FlowLang format (6 spaces for container children)

**4. Canonical Field Order (lines 664-678, 889-1004)**
- Reordered export sections to match FlowLang conventions
- Order: `flow → description → inputs → connections → triggers → steps → outputs → on_cancel`
- Steps come before outputs (was reversed before)

**Tasks Completed:**
- ✅ 4.1. Recursive export using `buildStep()` with parent chain traversal
- ✅ 4.2. Root vs child node identification via `parentId`
- ✅ 4.3. Conditional routing via edge following (Phase 2 architecture)
- ✅ 4.4. Loop children gathered via `parentId` filter
- ✅ 4.5. Parallel children gathered via `parentId` filter
- ✅ 4.6. Recursive container processing in `buildStep()`
- ✅ 4.7. Y-position sorting for step order
- ✅ 4.8. Quantified conditions export working
- ✅ 4.9. Helpful comments added for all sections
- ✅ 4.10. Mixed sequential/nested steps working

**Test Criteria:**
- ✅ Import test-nested-loop-in-parallel.yaml, then export - matches original
- ✅ Exported YAML is semantically equivalent to original
- ✅ Nested structure preserved (3 levels: Parallel > Loop > Parallel)
- ✅ Parallel inside loop exports correctly
- ✅ Sequential tasks mixed with containers work
- ✅ Quantified conditions (all/any/none) export properly
- ✅ Round-trip test passes (Import → Export → Import produces identical structure)

**Test Files Used:**
- `test-nested-loop-in-parallel.yaml` - Loop inside Parallel (2 levels)
- `test-nested-parallel-in-loop.yaml` - Parallel inside Loop (2 levels)
- `test-nested-deep-three-levels.yaml` - 3-level deep nesting

**Result:**
✅ Round-trip success achieved - all test files import and export with 100% fidelity (ignoring comments).

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-18)**

### Phase 5: Property Panel for Nested Editing
**Goal:** Edit nested structures through property panels

**Files to Modify:**
- `web/src/components/PropertyPanel/ConditionalNodeProperties.tsx`
- `web/src/components/PropertyPanel/ParallelNodeProperties.tsx`
- `web/src/components/PropertyPanel/LoopNodeProperties.tsx`
- `web/src/components/PropertyPanel/PropertyPanel.tsx`

**Tasks:**
5.1. Add "View Children" section showing list of child nodes
5.2. Add buttons to reorder children (move up/down)
5.3. Add button to remove child from container
5.4. Add button to add new task to section (quick add)
5.5. For conditionals: Show which section each child belongs to (then/else)
5.6. For parallel: Show track assignments for each child
5.7. For conditionals: Add UI to edit nested quantified conditions (all/any/none)
5.8. Add UI to nest quantifiers (drag-and-drop or tree view)
5.9. Validate condition structure (prevent circular nesting)
5.10. Add "Collapse/Expand" toggle for large nested structures

**Test Criteria:**
- [ ] Select conditional node and see list of children in property panel
- [ ] Can reorder children using up/down buttons
- [ ] Can remove child from container via property panel
- [ ] Can add new task to "then" section via quick-add button
- [ ] Parallel tracks show which tasks are assigned to each
- [ ] Can edit complex quantified conditions visually
- [ ] Can nest conditions (all with nested any, etc.)
- [ ] Collapse/expand works for readability

**Expected Result:**
Can fully edit nested structures without directly dragging nodes - use property panel for precise control.

---

### Phase 6: Nested Execution Visualization - ✅ COMPLETE
**Goal:** Execute flows with nested structures and visualize execution

**Status: ✅ COMPLETE (2025-10-18)**

**Files Modified:**

- ✅ All execution states visible in real-time
- ✅ Branch highlighting works for conditionals and switches
- ✅ Loop iteration tracking accurate
- ✅ Parallel progress tracking accurate
- ✅ Auto-centering smooth and non-intrusive
- ✅ Execution logs show all container metadata

**Expected Result:**
Full execution visualization works for nested flows - can watch execution flow through complex hierarchies.

---

### Phase 7: Advanced Features (Nice-to-Have)
**Goal:** Polish and advanced capabilities

**Tasks:**
7.1. Add zoom/pan inside container sections for large nested flows
7.2. Add "focus mode" - isolate a container to edit its children
7.3. Add breadcrumb navigation for nested editing (Parent > Child > Grandchild)
7.4. Add minimap showing position in nested hierarchy

## Testing Strategy

### Per-Phase Testing
Each phase should be tested independently before proceeding:
1. Developer tests feature works
2. Create test flow demonstrating the feature
3. User tests and provides feedback
4. Fix issues before moving to next phase

### Integration Testing
After phases 1-4:
- Import all example flows in `flows/examples/`
- Edit each one and export
- Verify re-import works correctly

### Performance Testing
After phase 6:
- Create flow with 50 nested nodes
- Measure render time (<100ms)
- Measure YAML import time (<500ms)
- Measure execution simulation time

### User Acceptance Testing
After phase 6:
- Can reproduce loan_approval.yaml from scratch
- Can understand nested structure visually
- Can make complex edits confidently
- Execution visualization is clear

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Rendering performance** - Many nested nodes could be slow
   - Mitigation: Virtualization, lazy rendering, collapse/expand

2. **Layout complexity** - Auto-positioning nested nodes is hard
   - Mitigation: Start with simple vertical stacking, iterate based on feedback

3. **YAML export complexity** - Reconstructing hierarchy from graph is non-trivial
   - Mitigation: Store section metadata on nodes, traverse parent chain

### UX Risks
1. **Complexity overwhelms users** - Too many nesting levels confusing
   - Mitigation: Visual guides, depth indicators, focus mode

2. **Discoverability** - Users don't know they can nest
   - Mitigation: Tutorial, examples, visual hints in empty containers

## Timeline Estimate

**Phase 1:** 1-2 days (foundation work)
**Phase 2:** 2-3 days (complex recursive parsing)
**Phase 3:** 1-2 days (D&D interactions)
**Phase 4:** 2-3 days (complex recursive export)
**Phase 5:** 2-3 days (UI/UX for editing)
**Phase 6:** 2-3 days (execution integration)
**Phase 7:** 3-5 days (polish)

**Total MVP (Phases 1-4):** 6-10 days
**Total Full Feature (Phases 1-6):** 10-16 days
**Total Production Ready (Phases 1-7):** 13-21 days

3. ✅ Phase 2: Recursive YAML Import
4. ✅ Phase 2.5: Simulator Support for Routing Nodes
5. ✅ Phase 4: Recursive YAML Export (with round-trip testing)
6. ✅ Phase 6: Nested Execution Visualization (2025-10-18)

**Current Status:** MVP+ ACHIEVED ✅
- Core nested flow functionality working
- Full execution visualization implemented
- Round-trip YAML import/export with 100% fidelity

**Next Priorities:**
1. **Phase 5: Property Panel for Nested Editing** - Add UI for managing children in containers (see PHASE_5_PLAN.md)
2. **Phase 3: Nested Drag & Drop** (optional) - Enable drag-and-drop editing of nested structures
3. **Phase 7: Advanced Features** - Polish and production-ready features

**Recommended Next Step:** Start Phase 5 to enable comprehensive property panel editing of nested structures

## Notes

- Each phase should be testable independently
- Get user feedback after each phase before proceeding
- Prioritize correctness over performance initially
- Keep backwards compatibility - flat flows must still work
- Document edge cases as they're discovered
- Update this roadmap as new challenges emerge
