async with FlowLangClient("http://localhost:8000") as client:
    result = await client.execute_flow("HelloWorld", {"user_name": "Alice"})
    print(result.outputs["message"])

# Sync usage
client = FlowLangClient("http://localhost:8000")
result = client.execute_flow_sync("HelloWorld", {"user_name": "Alice"})
print(result.outputs["message"])
```

// Execute a flow
const result = await client.executeFlow('HelloWorld', { user_name: 'Alice' });
console.log(result.outputs.message);

// Streaming with events
await client.executeFlowStream('MyFlow', { input: 'value' }, {
  onEvent: (eventType, data) => {
    if (eventType === 'step_completed') {
      console.log(`Completed: ${data.step_id}`);
    }
  }
});
```

## Human-in-the-Loop / Approval Gates

Enable workflows to pause and wait for human approval or input before continuing execution.

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
steps:
  - task: CreatePurchaseOrder
    id: po
    outputs:
      - order_id
      - total_amount

  - approval:
      id: manager_approval
      prompt: "Approve purchase order ${po.order_id} for ${po.total_amount}?"
      approvers:
        - manager@company.com
      timeout: 24h
      on_timeout: reject

  - if: ${manager_approval.approved} == true
    then:
      - task: ProcessPayment
        inputs:
          order_id: ${po.order_id}
    else:
      - task: CancelOrder
```

**Features**:
- Pause flow execution until human responds
- Send notifications to approvers (email, Slack, etc.)
- Timeout handling (auto-reject/approve after X hours)
- Multiple approvers (any/all patterns)
- Approval comments/reasons
- Track who approved and when
- Approval delegation

**Use Cases**:
- Expense approvals
- Code deployment approvals
- Content moderation
- High-value transactions
- Sensitive operations requiring oversight

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Requires persistent flow state storage
- API endpoints to submit approvals
- UI for approval interface (web/mobile)
- Integration with notification systems

---

## Flow State Persistence

Save the complete state of a running flow so it can be paused, resumed later, or survive server restarts.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
flow: LongRunningDataProcessing
persistence:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_interval: 5m  # Auto-save every 5 minutes

steps:
  - task: FetchLargeDataset
    id: fetch
    checkpoint: true  # Force checkpoint after this step

  - for_each: ${fetch.records}
    as: record
    do:
      - task: ProcessRecord
        inputs:
          data: ${record}
    checkpoint_every: 100  # Checkpoint every 100 iterations
```

**Features**:
- **Pause/Resume**: Manually pause a flow and resume later
- **Crash Recovery**: Automatically resume from last checkpoint after server restart
- **Long-running Workflows**: Support multi-day/week workflows
- **Checkpointing**: Save state at specific points
- **State Inspection**: View saved flow state for debugging
- **State Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of completed flow states

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-day ETL processes
- Long-running batch jobs
- Workflows that process millions of items
- Workflows waiting for external events
- Workflows with approval gates

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Database storage for flow state
- Serialization of context and variables
- Handling of external resources (DB connections, file handles)
- State size management

---

## Flow Cancellation

Provide the ability to gracefully cancel a running flow, with proper cleanup and resource management.

**API/CLI Usage**:
```bash
# Cancel a running flow execution
flowlang cancel <execution_id>

# Or via API
POST /flows/MyFlow/executions/abc123/cancel
```

**Flow-level Support**:
```yaml
flow: DataProcessing

on_cancel:
  - task: CleanupTempFiles
  - task: ReleaseResources
  - task: SendCancellationNotification

steps:
  - task: LongRunningTask
    cancellable: true  # This task can be interrupted
    on_cancel:
      - task: RollbackChanges
```

**Features**:
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Allow tasks to finish current operation
- **Cleanup Handlers**: Run cleanup logic on cancellation
- **Force Cancel**: Immediate termination if graceful fails
- **Cancellation Propagation**: Cancel subflows when parent is cancelled
- **Cancellation Reasons**: Track who cancelled and why
- **Non-cancellable Steps**: Mark critical steps that can't be interrupted

**Use Cases**:
- User-initiated cancellation (changed their mind)
- Timeout enforcement (cancel after max duration)
- Resource constraints (cancel low-priority flows)
- Cascading cancellations (parent flow cancelled)
- Emergency shutdowns

---

## Interactive Flow Visualization

Provide an interactive diagram viewer for flows - enhanced visualization beyond static Mermaid diagrams.

**Interactive Features**:
- **Click to Inspect**: Click on nodes to see task details, inputs, outputs
- **Zoom/Pan**: Navigate large, complex flows
- **Path Highlighting**: Highlight execution paths based on conditions
- **Execution Replay**: Show which path was taken in past executions
- **Live Execution View**: Watch flow execute in real-time with node highlighting
- **Collapse/Expand**: Collapse parallel/loop sections for cleaner view
- **Search**: Find specific tasks in complex flows
- **Export**: Export to image (PNG, SVG)

**Read-only Viewer** (not an editor):
```bash
# Launch interactive viewer
flowlang view flow.yaml

# Or via web UI
http://localhost:8000/flows/MyFlow/visualize?interactive=true
```

**Additional Features**:
- Filter by step type (tasks, conditionals, loops)
- Compare multiple flow versions side-by-side
- Annotate diagrams with notes
- Share interactive views via URL

**Why it matters**:
Complex flows need interactive exploration. A viewer helps understand flow structure, debug execution paths, and communicate with non-technical stakeholders.

**Note**: This is simpler than a full visual editor but more useful than static diagrams. To be explored in detail.

    id: agent
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4
    tools: [SearchDatabase, SendEmail, CreateTicket]
    max_iterations: 5
    goal: "Resolve user's support request"
```

**Use Cases**:
- Content generation and summarization
- Data extraction from unstructured text
- Classification and sentiment analysis
- Chatbots and conversational flows
- Code generation and analysis
- AI-powered decision making

steps:
  - db_query:
      id: fetch_users
      connection: postgres://...
      query: |
        SELECT * FROM users
        WHERE created_at > ${inputs.since_date}
        LIMIT 100
      outputs:
        - users

  - db_execute:
      id: update_status
      connection: postgres://...
      query: |
        UPDATE orders
        SET status = 'processed'
        WHERE order_id = ${inputs.order_id}
      outputs:
        - rows_affected

  - db_transaction:
      id: transfer
      connection: postgres://...
      steps:
        - query: "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ${amount} WHERE id = ${from_account}"
        - query: "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ${amount} WHERE id = ${to_account}"
      rollback_on_error: true
```

**Features**:
- **Multiple Database Support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections across tasks
- **Transaction Support**: Multi-step atomic operations
- **Query Parameterization**: Prevent SQL injection
- **Result Mapping**: Convert rows to objects
- **Streaming Results**: Handle large result sets
- **Migration Support**: Run schema migrations

**Additional Patterns**:
```yaml
# Batch inserts
- db_batch_insert:
    connection: postgres://...
    table: products
    records: ${previous_step.items}
    batch_size: 1000

# Batch updates
- db_batch_update:
    connection: postgres://...
    table: users
    updates: ${user_changes}
    key_field: user_id
```

**Why it matters**:
Most workflows interact with databases. Built-in database tasks eliminate boilerplate and make common operations trivial without writing Python code. Users can still write custom tasks for complex scenarios.
