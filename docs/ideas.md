---

## Message Queue Integration

Trigger flows from message queues and event streams.

### Configuration
```yaml
flow: ProcessMessage
triggers:
  - type: queue
    provider: rabbitmq
    queue: orders
    batch_size: 10
    prefetch: 5
    retry:
      max_attempts: 3
      backoff: exponential
```

- Asynchronous job processing
- Distributed workflows
- High-throughput data pipelines

---

## Flow Debugger

Step-through debugging for flow execution.

### Interactive Debugger
```bash
flowlang debug flow.yaml --inputs '{"user_name": "Alice"}'
```

**Features**:
- Set breakpoints on tasks
- Step through execution
- Inspect context at each step
- Evaluate variable expressions
- Continue, skip, or retry tasks

### Time-Travel Debugging
- Record full execution trace
- Rewind to any point
- Inspect state at that moment
- Re-execute from that point
- Compare different execution paths

### VS Code Debugger Integration
- Launch configuration for flows
- Breakpoint support in flow.yaml
- Variable inspection
- Debug console for context queries

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Requires execution history storage
- Breakpoint injection in executor
- State snapshot mechanism

---

## Interactive Flow Visualization

Provide an interactive diagram viewer for flows - enhanced visualization beyond static Mermaid diagrams.

**Interactive Features**:
- **Click to Inspect**: Click on nodes to see task details, inputs, outputs
- **Zoom/Pan**: Navigate large, complex flows
- **Path Highlighting**: Highlight execution paths based on conditions
- **Execution Replay**: Show which path was taken in past executions
- **Live Execution View**: Watch flow execute in real-time with node highlighting
- **Collapse/Expand**: Collapse parallel/loop sections for cleaner view
- **Search**: Find specific tasks in complex flows
- **Export**: Export to image (PNG, SVG)

**Read-only Viewer** (not an editor):
```bash
# Launch interactive viewer
flowlang view flow.yaml

# Or via web UI
http://localhost:8000/flows/MyFlow/visualize?interactive=true
```

**Additional Features**:
- Filter by step type (tasks, conditionals, loops)
- Compare multiple flow versions side-by-side
- Annotate diagrams with notes
- Share interactive views via URL

**Why it matters**:
Complex flows need interactive exploration. A viewer helps understand flow structure, debug execution paths, and communicate with non-technical stakeholders.

**Note**: This is simpler than a full visual editor but more useful than static diagrams.

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Frontend app (React or Vue)
- WebSocket for live updates
- Graph layout algorithms
- SVG rendering
- State synchronization

      id: summarize
      provider: openai
      model: gpt-4
      prompt: |
        Summarize the following text in 3 sentences:
        ${inputs.article_text}
      outputs:
        - summary

  - llm:
      id: classify
      provider: anthropic
      model: claude-3-sonnet
      prompt: |
        Classify this support ticket:
        ${inputs.ticket_text}

        Categories: technical, billing, general
      outputs:
        - category

## Human-in-the-Loop / Approval Gates

Enable workflows to pause and wait for human approval or input before continuing execution.

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
steps:
  - task: CreatePurchaseOrder
    id: po
    outputs:
      - order_id
      - total_amount

  - approval:
      id: manager_approval
      prompt: "Approve purchase order ${po.order_id} for ${po.total_amount}?"
      approvers:
        - manager@company.com
      timeout: 24h
      on_timeout: reject

  - if: ${manager_approval.approved} == true
    then:
      - task: ProcessPayment
        inputs:
          order_id: ${po.order_id}
    else:
      - task: CancelOrder
```

**Features**:
- Pause flow execution until human responds
- Send notifications to approvers (email, Slack, etc.)
- Timeout handling (auto-reject/approve after X hours)

- Database for pending approvals
- Security and authorization

---

## Flow State Persistence

Save the complete state of a running flow so it can be paused, resumed later, or survive server restarts.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
flow: LongRunningDataProcessing
persistence:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_interval: 5m  # Auto-save every 5 minutes

steps:
  - task: FetchLargeDataset
    id: fetch
    checkpoint: true  # Force checkpoint after this step

  - for_each: ${fetch.records}
    as: record
    do:
      - task: ProcessRecord
        inputs:
          data: ${record}
    checkpoint_every: 100  # Checkpoint every 100 iterations
```

**Features**:
- **Pause/Resume**: Manually pause a flow and resume later
- **Crash Recovery**: Automatically resume from last checkpoint after server restart
- **Long-running Workflows**: Support multi-day/week workflows
- **Checkpointing**: Save state at specific points
- **State Inspection**: View saved flow state for debugging
- **State Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of completed flow states

**API Endpoints**:
```bash
# Pause a running flow
POST /flows/{name}/executions/{id}/pause

# Resume a paused flow
POST /flows/{name}/executions/{id}/resume

# List checkpoints
GET /flows/{name}/executions/{id}/checkpoints

# Restore from checkpoint
POST /flows/{name}/executions/{id}/restore?checkpoint_id=xyz
```

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-day ETL processes
- Long-running batch jobs
- Workflows that process millions of items
- Workflows waiting for external events
- Workflows with approval gates

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Database storage for flow state
- Serialization of context and variables
