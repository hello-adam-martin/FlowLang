- **Structure Visualization**: Show sequential, parallel, conditional, and loop structures
- **Documentation Integration**: Embed diagrams in auto-generated README files
- **CLI Command**: `flowlang visualize flow.yaml` or `flowlang visualize flow.yaml --output diagram.png`
- **Multiple Formats**: Support Mermaid (markdown), SVG, PNG output

**Benefits**:
- Quick to implement (Mermaid has good Python libraries)
- Immediate documentation value
- Foundation for future interactive visualizer
- Easy to integrate into scaffolder

### Advanced Version (Web UI)
- **Interactive Graph**: D3.js or React Flow visualization
- **Node Interaction**: Click nodes to see task details, inputs, outputs
- **Path Exploration**: Show execution paths with different input scenarios
- **Live Execution Tracking**: Highlight active steps during execution
- **Visual Editor**: Drag-and-drop flow design with YAML export
- **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate complex workflows easily
- **Execution History**: Replay past executions visually

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Web-based UI (React + FastAPI backend)
- WebSocket for live execution updates
- Could be standalone app or integrated into existing server
- Export to flow.yaml from visual editor

---

## Client SDKs (In Progress)

Make it easy to call FlowLang flows from other applications.

### Python Client
```python
from flowlang_client import FlowLangClient

client = FlowLangClient("http://localhost:8000")
result = await client.execute_flow("HelloWorld", {"user_name": "Alice"})
print(result.outputs["message"])
```

**Features**:
- Type-safe flow execution
- Auto-generated from flow definitions
- Async and sync support
- Exception handling and retries
- Streaming support for long-running flows

### TypeScript/JavaScript Client
```typescript
import { FlowLangClient } from '@flowlang/client';

const client = new FlowLangClient('http://localhost:8000');
const result = await client.executeFlow('HelloWorld', { user_name: 'Alice' });
console.log(result.outputs.message);
```

**Features**:
- Full TypeScript types
- Promise-based API
- Browser and Node.js support
- WebSocket support for live updates

## Monitoring & Observability

Production-grade monitoring and debugging capabilities.

### Execution History
- Store flow execution records (inputs, outputs, duration)
- Query by flow name, time range, status
- Retention policies (keep last N days)
- Export to JSON/CSV

### Performance Metrics
- Per-task execution time
- Flow-level metrics (p50, p95, p99)
- Identify bottlenecks
- Historical trends

### Distributed Tracing
- Trace ID propagation across subflows
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Correlate with external services
- Visual trace timeline

### Dashboard

---

## Event-Driven Triggers

Enable flows to be triggered by external events.

### Webhook Support
```yaml
flow: ProcessOrder
triggers:
  - type: webhook
    path: /orders/new
    method: POST
    auth: bearer_token
```

**Features**:
- Automatic webhook endpoint creation
- Authentication (API keys, OAuth)
- Payload validation
- Rate limiting

### Scheduled Execution
```yaml
flow: DailyReport
triggers:
  - type: schedule
    cron: "0 9 * * *"  # Every day at 9am
    timezone: "America/New_York"
```

**Features**:
- Cron-based scheduling
- Timezone support
- One-time vs recurring
- Missed execution handling

### Message Queue Integration
```yaml
flow: ProcessMessage
triggers:
  - type: queue
    provider: rabbitmq
    queue: orders
    batch_size: 10
```

**Supported Providers**:
- RabbitMQ
- AWS SQS

- Redis Streams

---

## Flow Composition & Subflows

Enable reusable workflows and composition patterns.

### Subflow Execution
```yaml
steps:
  - subflow: ValidateUser
    id: validation
    inputs:
      user_id: ${inputs.user_id}
    outputs:
      - is_valid
      - user_data

  - task: ProcessUser
    if: ${validation.is_valid}
    inputs:
      user: ${validation.user_data}
```

**Features**:
- Reference flows by name
- Pass data between flows
- Nested execution context
- Error propagation
- Circular dependency detection

### Shared Task Libraries
```yaml
# common_tasks.yaml
tasks:
  - name: SendEmail
    description: Send email via SMTP
    inputs:
      - to
      - subject
      - body

# my_flow.yaml
imports:
  - common_tasks.yaml

steps:
  - task: SendEmail  # Imported from common_tasks
```

**Benefits**:
- DRY principle for workflows
- Organization-wide task catalog
- Versioning for shared tasks
- Discoverability

## Testing Framework

Enable thorough testing of flows and tasks.

### Flow-Level Tests
```python

class TestHelloWorld(FlowTest):
    flow_path = "flow.yaml"

    async def test_valid_user(self):
        result = await self.execute_flow({"user_name": "Alice"})
        self.assert_success(result)
        self.assertEqual(result.outputs["message"], "Hello, Alice!")

    async def test_empty_name(self):
        result = await self.execute_flow({"user_name": ""})
        self.assert_failure(result)
```

### Mock Tasks
```python
@flow_test.mock_task('SendEmail')
async def mock_send_email(**inputs):
    return {'status': 'sent', 'message_id': 'test-123'}
```

### Test Fixtures
```yaml
# tests/fixtures/test_data.yaml
test_cases:
  - name: valid_user
    inputs:
      user_name: Alice
    expected_outputs:
      message: "Hello, Alice!"

  - name: invalid_user
    inputs:
      user_name: ""
    expect_error: true
```

### Assertion Helpers
- `assert_success()` / `assert_failure()`
- `assert_output_equals()`
- `assert_task_called()`
- `assert_execution_time_under()`

## Flow Templates & Gallery

Accelerate development with pre-built patterns.

### Built-in Templates
```bash
flowlang new my-flow --template approval-workflow
flowlang new etl-job --template etl-pipeline
flowlang new api-integration --template rest-api-client
```

**Template Categories**:
- **Approval Workflows**: Human-in-the-loop patterns
- **ETL Pipelines**: Extract, transform, load patterns
- **API Integrations**: REST/GraphQL client flows
- **Notifications**: Email, SMS, Slack, webhooks
- **Data Processing**: Batch processing, aggregation
- **Orchestration**: Multi-service coordination

### Template Structure
```
templates/
â”œâ”€â”€ approval-workflow/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ flow.yaml
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ flow.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.json
```

### Community Gallery
- User-contributed templates
- Rating and reviews
- Search and discovery
- One-click install: `flowlang install template:user/workflow-name`

---

## Enhanced VS Code Integration

Build on existing schema/snippets support.

### Jump to Definition
- Click task name in flow.yaml â†’ jump to implementation in flow.py
- Ctrl+Click on step references

### Inline Execution
- Code lens: "â–¶ Run Flow" button in flow.yaml
- Quick input dialog
- Results in output panel

### Flow Validation Beyond Schema
- Check that all referenced tasks are registered
- Validate variable references (step IDs exist)
- Warn about unused outputs
- Suggest outputs for tasks

### Quick Fixes
- "Generate task stub" for unregistered tasks
- "Add output to step" when output is referenced but not declared
- "Fix variable reference" for typos

### FlowLang Extension
- Custom language server
- Richer validation
- Refactoring support (rename step ID updates all references)
- Flow preview panel

- Parallel execution optimization
- Connection pooling for database tasks
- Lazy evaluation of unused branches

### Security
- Task-level permissions
- Secrets management (vault integration)
- Input sanitization
- Audit logging

### Flow Versioning
- Version flows in YAML (`version: 1.0.0`)
- Migration scripts between versions

- API key management
- Request/response transformation
- CORS configuration

### Developer Experience

- Shell completion (bash, zsh, fish)

### Collaboration Features
- Flow comments and annotations
- Change tracking (who edited what)
- Review/approval process for flows
- Team dashboards
