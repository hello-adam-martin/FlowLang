## Flow Composition & Subflows

Enable reusable workflows and composition patterns.

### Subflow Execution
```yaml
steps:
  - subflow: ValidateUser
    id: validation
    inputs:
      user_id: ${inputs.user_id}
    outputs:
      - is_valid
      - user_data

  - task: ProcessUser
    if: ${validation.is_valid}
    inputs:
      user: ${validation.user_data}
```

**Features**:
- Reference flows by name
- Pass data between flows
- Nested execution context
- Error propagation
- Circular dependency detection

### Shared Task Libraries
```yaml
# common_tasks.yaml
tasks:
  - name: SendEmail
    description: Send email via SMTP
    inputs:
      - to
      - subject
      - body

# my_flow.yaml
imports:
  - common_tasks.yaml

steps:
  - task: SendEmail  # Imported from common_tasks
```

**Benefits**:
- DRY principle for workflows
- Organization-wide task catalog
- Versioning for shared tasks
- Discoverability

---

## Testing Framework

Enable thorough testing of flows and tasks.

### Flow-Level Tests
```python
from flowlang.testing import FlowTest

class TestHelloWorld(FlowTest):
    flow_path = "flow.yaml"

    async def test_valid_user(self):
        result = await self.execute_flow({"user_name": "Alice"})
        self.assert_success(result)
        self.assertEqual(result.outputs["message"], "Hello, Alice!")

    async def test_empty_name(self):
        result = await self.execute_flow({"user_name": ""})
        self.assert_failure(result)
```

### Mock Tasks
```python
@flow_test.mock_task('SendEmail')
async def mock_send_email(**inputs):
    return {'status': 'sent', 'message_id': 'test-123'}
```

### Test Fixtures
```yaml
# tests/fixtures/test_data.yaml
test_cases:
  - name: valid_user
    inputs:
      user_name: Alice
    expected_outputs:
      message: "Hello, Alice!"

  - name: invalid_user
    inputs:
      user_name: ""
    expect_error: true
```

### Assertion Helpers
- `assert_success()` / `assert_failure()`
- `assert_output_equals()`
- `assert_task_called()`
- `assert_execution_time_under()`

---

## Flow Debugger

│   └── config.json
```

### Community Gallery
- User-contributed templates
- Rating and reviews
- Search and discovery
- One-click install: `flowlang install template:user/workflow-name`

---

## Human-in-the-Loop / Approval Gates

Enable workflows to pause and wait for human approval or input before continuing execution.

**Workflow Pattern**:
```yaml
steps:
  - task: CreatePurchaseOrder
    id: po
    outputs:
      - order_id
      - total_amount

  - approval:
      id: manager_approval
      prompt: "Approve purchase order ${po.order_id} for ${po.total_amount}?"
      approvers:
        - manager@company.com
      timeout: 24h
      on_timeout: reject

  - if: ${manager_approval.approved} == true
    then:
      - task: ProcessPayment
        inputs:
          order_id: ${po.order_id}
    else:
      - task: CancelOrder
```

**Features**:
- Pause flow execution until human responds
- Send notifications to approvers (email, Slack, etc.)
- Timeout handling (auto-reject/approve after X hours)
- Multiple approvers (any/all patterns)
- Approval comments/reasons
- Track who approved and when
- Approval delegation

**Use Cases**:
- Expense approvals
- Code deployment approvals
- Content moderation
- High-value transactions
- Sensitive operations requiring oversight

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Requires persistent flow state storage
- API endpoints to submit approvals
- UI for approval interface (web/mobile)
- Integration with notification systems

---

## Flow State Persistence

Save the complete state of a running flow so it can be paused, resumed later, or survive server restarts.

**Configuration**:
```yaml
flow: LongRunningDataProcessing
persistence:
  enabled: true
  checkpoint_interval: 5m  # Auto-save every 5 minutes

steps:
  - task: FetchLargeDataset
    id: fetch
    checkpoint: true  # Force checkpoint after this step

  - for_each: ${fetch.records}
    as: record
    do:
      - task: ProcessRecord
        inputs:
          data: ${record}
    checkpoint_every: 100  # Checkpoint every 100 iterations
```

**Features**:
- **Pause/Resume**: Manually pause a flow and resume later
- **Crash Recovery**: Automatically resume from last checkpoint after server restart
- **Long-running Workflows**: Support multi-day/week workflows
- **Checkpointing**: Save state at specific points
- **State Inspection**: View saved flow state for debugging
- **State Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of completed flow states

**Use Cases**:
- Multi-day ETL processes
- Long-running batch jobs
- Workflows that process millions of items
- Workflows waiting for external events
- Workflows with approval gates

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Database storage for flow state
- Serialization of context and variables
- Handling of external resources (DB connections, file handles)
- State size management

---

## Flow Cancellation

Provide the ability to gracefully cancel a running flow, with proper cleanup and resource management.

**API/CLI Usage**:
```bash
# Cancel a running flow execution
flowlang cancel <execution_id>

# Or via API
POST /flows/MyFlow/executions/abc123/cancel
```

**Flow-level Support**:
```yaml
flow: DataProcessing

on_cancel:
  - task: CleanupTempFiles
  - task: ReleaseResources
  - task: SendCancellationNotification

steps:
  - task: LongRunningTask
    cancellable: true  # This task can be interrupted
    on_cancel:
      - task: RollbackChanges
```

**Features**:
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Allow tasks to finish current operation
- **Cleanup Handlers**: Run cleanup logic on cancellation
- **Force Cancel**: Immediate termination if graceful fails
- **Cancellation Propagation**: Cancel subflows when parent is cancelled
- **Cancellation Reasons**: Track who cancelled and why
- **Non-cancellable Steps**: Mark critical steps that can't be interrupted

**Use Cases**:
- User-initiated cancellation (changed their mind)
- Timeout enforcement (cancel after max duration)
- Resource constraints (cancel low-priority flows)
- Cascading cancellations (parent flow cancelled)
- Emergency shutdowns

---

## Interactive Flow Visualization

Provide an interactive diagram viewer for flows - enhanced visualization beyond static Mermaid diagrams.

**Interactive Features**:
- **Click to Inspect**: Click on nodes to see task details, inputs, outputs
- **Zoom/Pan**: Navigate large, complex flows
- **Path Highlighting**: Highlight execution paths based on conditions
- **Execution Replay**: Show which path was taken in past executions
- **Live Execution View**: Watch flow execute in real-time with node highlighting
- **Collapse/Expand**: Collapse parallel/loop sections for cleaner view
- **Search**: Find specific tasks in complex flows
- **Export**: Export to image (PNG, SVG)

**Read-only Viewer** (not an editor):
```bash
# Launch interactive viewer
flowlang view flow.yaml

# Or via web UI
http://localhost:8000/flows/MyFlow/visualize?interactive=true
```

**Additional Features**:
- Filter by step type (tasks, conditionals, loops)
- Compare multiple flow versions side-by-side
- Annotate diagrams with notes
- Share interactive views via URL

**Why it matters**:
Complex flows need interactive exploration. A viewer helps understand flow structure, debug execution paths, and communicate with non-technical stakeholders.

**Note**: This is simpler than a full visual editor but more useful than static diagrams. To be explored in detail.

## AI/LLM Integration

Provide built-in support for AI/LLM operations with prompt templating, model management, and common AI workflow patterns.

**Built-in AI Task Types**:
```yaml
steps:
  - llm:
      id: summarize
      provider: openai
      model: gpt-4
      prompt: |
        Summarize the following text in 3 sentences:
        ${inputs.article_text}
      outputs:
        - summary

  - llm:
      id: classify
      provider: anthropic
      model: claude-3-sonnet
      prompt: |
        Classify this support ticket:
        ${inputs.ticket_text}

        Categories: technical, billing, general
      outputs:
        - category
        - confidence
```

**Features**:
- **Provider Support**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, local models (Ollama, etc.)
- **Prompt Templates**: Reusable, parameterized prompts
- **Token Management**: Track usage, costs, rate limits
- **Retries/Fallbacks**: Handle API failures gracefully
- **Streaming**: Support streaming responses
- **Function Calling**: LLM can call FlowLang tasks
- **Prompt Library**: Common prompts (summarize, classify, extract, translate, etc.)

**AI Workflow Patterns**:
```yaml
# Agent pattern
- llm:
    id: agent
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4
    tools: [SearchDatabase, SendEmail, CreateTicket]
    max_iterations: 5
    goal: "Resolve user's support request"
```

**Use Cases**:
- Content generation and summarization
- Data extraction from unstructured text
- Classification and sentiment analysis
- Chatbots and conversational flows
- Code generation and analysis
- AI-powered decision making
- Document processing

---

## Database Integration Helpers

Provide built-in task types and helpers for common database operations.

**Built-in Database Tasks**:
```yaml
steps:
  - db_query:
      id: fetch_users
      connection: postgres://...
      query: |
        SELECT * FROM users
        WHERE created_at > ${inputs.since_date}
        LIMIT 100
      outputs:
        - users

  - db_execute:
      id: update_status
      connection: postgres://...
      query: |
        UPDATE orders
        SET status = 'processed'
        WHERE order_id = ${inputs.order_id}
      outputs:
        - rows_affected

  - db_transaction:
      id: transfer
      connection: postgres://...
      steps:
        - query: "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ${amount} WHERE id = ${from_account}"
        - query: "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ${amount} WHERE id = ${to_account}"
      rollback_on_error: true
```

**Features**:
- **Multiple Database Support**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB, Redis
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse connections across tasks
- **Transaction Support**: Multi-step atomic operations
- **Query Parameterization**: Prevent SQL injection
- **Result Mapping**: Convert rows to objects
- **Streaming Results**: Handle large result sets
- **Migration Support**: Run schema migrations

**Additional Patterns**:
```yaml
# Batch inserts
- db_batch_insert:
    connection: postgres://...
    table: products
    records: ${previous_step.items}
    batch_size: 1000

# Batch updates
- db_batch_update:
    connection: postgres://...
    table: users
    updates: ${user_changes}
    key_field: user_id
```

**Why it matters**:
Most workflows interact with databases. Built-in database tasks eliminate boilerplate and make common operations trivial without writing Python code. Users can still write custom tasks for complex scenarios.

## Implementation Priority (Easiest to Hardest)

This ranking is based on implementation complexity, from simplest to most complex:

### Tier 1: Quick Wins (Easiest)
1. **Flow Templates & Gallery** - Create pre-built flow.yaml templates with substitution
2. **Client SDKs** - HTTP wrappers around existing API (Python, TypeScript)
3. **Flow Cancellation** - Add cancellation tokens and cleanup handlers to execution context

### Tier 2: Moderate Complexity
4. **Developer Experience Tools** - CLI commands (init, doctor, upgrade) and shell completion
5. **Testing Framework** - Build on existing executor with mocks and assertion helpers
6. **Database Integration Helpers** - Use existing DB libraries; create built-in task types
7. **Flow Composition & Subflows** - Recursive flow execution with context nesting
8. **Event-Driven Triggers** - Webhooks (FastAPI), scheduling (APScheduler), message queues

### Tier 3: Significant Effort
9. **API Gateway Integration** - Rate limiting, API keys, CORS, request transformation
10. **Security Features** - Authorization system, secrets management, audit logging
11. **Flow State Persistence** - Serialize context, database storage, resume logic with consistency
12. **Performance Optimization** - Result caching, connection pooling, lazy evaluation

### Tier 4: Complex Projects (Hardest)
13. **Interactive Flow Visualization** - Frontend app with real-time updates and WebSockets
14. **Flow Debugger** - Breakpoints in async execution, time-travel debugging, VS Code extension
15. **Human-in-the-Loop / Approval Gates** - Requires state persistence + notification system + approval UI
16. **Monitoring & Observability** - Execution history DB, metrics, distributed tracing, dashboard
17. **AI/LLM Integration** - Multiple provider integrations, token management, streaming, function calling, agents

---

**Note**: This ranking prioritizes implementation complexity. Business value and dependencies may affect actual implementation order. For example, Testing Framework (Tier 2) should likely be implemented early despite moderate complexity due to its foundational importance.
